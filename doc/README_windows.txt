Intro
-----
vDinar is a free open source digital currency aimed to people from former
Yugoslavia, yet available to everyone. It is based on a new block structure
allocating 2% of every reward and a transaction fee percentage to an address
for local donations.


Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run vdinar-qt.exe.

vDinar-Qt is the original vDinar client and it builds the backbone of the network.
However, it downloads and stores the entire history of vDinar transactions;
depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization
process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

Intro
---------------------
vDinar is a free open source digital currency aimed to people from former
Yugoslavia, yet available to everyone. It is based on a new block structure
allocating 2% of every reward and a transaction fee percentage to an address
for local donations.


Setup
---------------------
You need the Qt4 run-time libraries to run vDinar-Qt. On Debian or Ubuntu:
	`sudo apt-get install libqtgui4`

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- bin/32/vdinar-qt (GUI, 32-bit)
- bin/32/vdinard (headless, 32-bit)
- bin/64/vdinar-qt (GUI, 64-bit)
- bin/64/vdinard (headless, 64-bit)

See the documentation at the [vDinar Website](https://www.vdinar.info)
for help and more information.
